# Fonix
A UNIX like operating system for Phones and everything else.

The idea is to incorporate the best ideas from Windows, Android, Linux and BSD(read-iOS).

The system is divided in 3 parts;
1. User Space
2. AI Space
3. Kernel

- The kernel can be enhanced by installing modules as Linux does.
- The Filesystem will be windows like.
- The concept of Apps and Package manager will be borrowed from Android and Linux and Fuchsia.
- The supported languages will be : C, C++, Nim, D, Python3, Lua, Ruby. 
- Other languages can be added as global modules to increase system wide access.
- Fonts are a serious issue .. so, any suggestion will be welcomed.



BTW .. how to survive around idiots?
